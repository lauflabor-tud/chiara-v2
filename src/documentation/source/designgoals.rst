Design goals for Chiara
=======================

Chiara is a tool to backup and share your collected data.
The design goals for Chiara are as follows: 

    * **Simplicity** 

      Chiara should be very simple to use, with almost no modification to
      users' daily workflow.

    * **Data Sharing**

      It should be able to share your data within the Workgroup and other
      scientific workgroups through the internet.

    * **Backup**

      Using Chiara should at the same time be a backup for your data.

    * **Flexibility**

      Chiara should be suitable for all kinds of data, e.g.:

        * experimental data

        * simulation data

        * robots experiments

        * CAD drawings

        * MatLab Code

        * Simulink(R) models

    * **Search function**

      Despite its minimalistic structure, searching (e.g., for keywords or
      authors) should be possible

Approach
--------

There is a certain, defined directory structure, which users must adapt. The
central element (top level) is the "collection". That could be the name of an
experiment performed, e.g. "TENS"
